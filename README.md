After I read "Good Developer Mindset" I figure out:

1. The Goals of Software Design
    - create software that will help users and your software will continue to help them for a long time.

2. Showing off that you are smart doesn’t help developers.

3. Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.

4. It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.

5. Code that isn’t consistent becomes harder to understand. Don’t keep forcing developers to relearn the way your system works every time they look at a new piece of it.

6. The equation is simple: D=V/E
    - The desirability of a change (D): How much do you want that change to happen?
    - The value of a change (V): How much value does the change offer? How much does it help your users?
    - The effort required to perform the change (E): How much work will you need to do to accomplish this change?

7. Think before acting.

8. Start small, improve it, then extend.

9. Being too generic involves a lot of code that isn’t needed.

10. Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.

11. Don’t reinvent the wheel.

12. If you can automate it, automate it

13. Untested code is the code that doesn’t work.

14. Everything takes longer than you think.

15. Rewriting code is often a developer delusion, not the solution in most cases.
